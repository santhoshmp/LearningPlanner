# Learning Objectives Comprehensive Fix

## Problem Description
The study plan generation had multiple issues with learning objectives and activities not matching the selected subject and topics:

1. **Learning Objectives Mismatch**: Science study plans were showing math objectives like "Apply algebraic thinking", "Understand geometry concepts", "Solve complex multi-step problems"
2. **Activities Mismatch**: Science plans were showing math activities like "Number Recognition Practice", "Basic Addition Problems", "Shape Identification Game"
3. **Subject Key Mapping Issue**: The system used hardcoded keys like "MATH", "SCIENCE" but received subject names like "Mathematics", "Science"

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Subject Name Normalization Issue
- Frontend sends: "Mathematics", "English", "Science", "History", "Geography"
- Backend templates used: "MATH", "ENGLISH", "SCIENCE", "HISTORY", "GEOGRAPHY"
- This mismatch caused all subjects to fall back to the MATH template

### 2. Incomplete Topic Coverage
- Topic-specific activities database was missing many science topics
- Limited coverage for advanced topics across all subjects
- No proper mapping between curriculum topics and learning objectives

### 3. Generic Fallback System
- When topic-specific generation failed, system fell back to generic templates
- Generic templates didn't consider the actual subject being requested
- No validation to ensure subject-activity alignment

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Subject Normalization System
**Files Modified**: `backend/src/routes/studyPlans.ts`

Added normalization function to map frontend subject names to backend template keys:

```typescript
const normalizeSubject = (subjectName: string): string => {
  const subjectMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    'Mathematics': 'MATHEMATICS',
    'Math': 'MATHEMATICS',
    'English': 'ENGLISH',
    'Science': 'SCIENCE',
    'History': 'HISTORY',
    'Geography': 'GEOGRAPHY'
  };
  return subjectMap[subjectName] || subjectName.toUpperCase();
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Learning Objectives Templates
**Updated Function**: `generateObjectives()`

- Fixed subject key mapping using normalization
- Ensured each subject has appropriate, subject-specific objectives
- Added proper fallback handling

**Before Fix**:
```
Science Plan → MATH template → "Apply algebraic thinking"
```

**After Fix**:
```
Science Plan → SCIENCE template → "Apply scientific method to investigations"
```

### 3. Expanded Topic-Specific Activities Database
**File Enhanced**: `backend/src/data/topicSpecificActivities.ts`

Added comprehensive science activities for all curriculum topics:
- `living-nonliving`: Living vs Non-living classification activities
- `animal-habitats`: Animal habitat exploration activities  
- `weather-basics`: Weather observation and study activities
- `plant-parts`: Plant anatomy identification activities
- `human-body-systems`: Body systems interactive models
- `ecosystems`: Food chain and ecosystem balance activities
- `matter-states`: States of matter experiments
- `simple-machines`: Mechanical advantage workshops
- `earth-science`: Rock, mineral, and geological process studies
- `chemistry-basics`: Safe chemistry experiments
- `physics-motion`: Force, motion, and energy investigations
- `cell-biology`: Cell structure and function exploration
- `genetics-intro`: Heredity and DNA basics
- `environmental-science`: Environmental impact assessments

### 4. Improved Activity Generation
**Updated Function**: `generateActivities()`

- Applied same subject normalization
- Ensured fallback activities match the requested subject
- Added proper subject validation

### 5. Topic-Specific Objective Generation
**Enhanced Function**: `generateTopicSpecificObjectives()`

- Generates objectives directly from selected curriculum topics
- Creates objectives like "Master [Topic Name]: [Topic Description]"
- Ensures perfect alignment between selected topics and learning objectives
