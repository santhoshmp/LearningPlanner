## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import/Export Errors
```bash
# Error: Importing binding name 'ComponentName' is not found
# Solution: Check if component is exported in index.ts barrel file
```
**Fix**: Ensure all components are properly exported in their respective `index.ts` files:
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/common/index.ts
export { default as ComponentName } from './ComponentName';
export type { ComponentNameProps } from './ComponentName';

// For components with multiple exports
export { default as BadgeDisplay } from './BadgeDisplay';
export { default as BadgeCollection } from './BadgeCollection';
export { default as BadgeEarnedModal } from './BadgeEarnedModal';
```

#### Child Authentication Issues

**Session Management Problems**
```bash
# Issue: Authentication conflicts or corrupted session data
# Solution: ChildLoginForm automatically clears sessions on mount
```
**Fix**: The ChildLoginForm component now automatically clears any existing session data on component mount to prevent authentication conflicts:
```typescript
// Automatic session cleanup on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  setUserRole('child');
  
  // Clear any existing session on component mount
  SessionManager.clearSession();
  
  // Continue with device info capture...
}, []);
```

**Login State Issues**
```bash
# Issue: Inconsistent authentication state between components
# Solution: Use proper AuthContext integration with SessionManager
```
**Fix**: Ensure proper synchronization between SessionManager and AuthContext:
```typescript
// Use SessionManager for direct session control
const sessionData = SessionManager.loadSession();

// Use AuthContext for global state management
const { login, logout, user } = useAuth();

// Coordinate both for consistent state
if (sessionData && !user) {
  // Sync session with context
  login(sessionData);
}
```

**Component Selection Guidelines**
- Use **SimpleChildLoginForm** for straightforward authentication flows with minimal complexity
- Use **ChildLoginForm** for complex authentication requirements with enhanced error handling and session management
- Both components now include automatic session cleanup for improved reliability
```bash
# Error: Child login fails with device info capture
# Solution: Ensure device information is properly captured and validated
```
**Fix**: Check device info capture in ChildLoginForm:
```typescript
// Ensure deviceInfo state is properly initialized
const [deviceInfo, setDeviceInfo] = useState<DeviceInfo | null>(null);

// Verify device info is captured before login
useEffect(() => {
  const info = captureDeviceInfo();
  setDeviceInfo(info);
}, []);
```

#### Authentication Method Call Issues
```bash
# Error: Syntax error in child login method call
# Solution: Ensure proper async/await syntax in authentication calls
```
**Fix**: Verify proper method call syntax in ChildLoginForm:
```typescript
// Correct syntax for child login method call (AuthContext approach)
const handleLogin = async () => {
  try {
    // Clear any existing session before attempting new login
    SessionManager.clearSession();
    
    // Use the AuthContext childLogin method with enhanced error handling
    await childLogin(username, pin);
    
    console.log('Child login successful through AuthContext');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Child login failed:', error);
    // Handle error appropriately
  }
};

// Alternative: Direct API approach (SimpleChildLoginForm)
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  try {
    // Clear any existing session
    SessionManager.clearSession();
    
    // Call the API directly
    const result = await authApi.childLogin(username, pin);
    
    // Create and save session
    const sessionData = SessionManager.createSessionFromAuthResult(result);
    SessionManager.saveSession(sessionData);
    
    // Navigate to dashboard
    navigate('/child-dashboard', { replace: true });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error with child-friendly messages
  }
};
```

#### SimpleChildLoginForm vs ChildLoginForm
```bash
# When to use SimpleChildLoginForm vs ChildLoginForm
# SimpleChildLoginForm: Direct API integration, simpler error handling
# ChildLoginForm: AuthContext integration, more complex features
```
**SimpleChildLoginForm Features**:
- Direct API calls with `authApi.childLogin()`
- Manual session management with `SessionManager`
- Simplified error handling with child-friendly messages
- Streamlined authentication flow
- Better control over session creation and navigation

**ChildLoginForm Features**:
- AuthContext integration for global state management
- Advanced device information capture
- Complex error recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced security monitoring
- Automatic session synchronization

**Choose SimpleChildLoginForm when**:
- You need a straightforward login flow
- Direct control over authentication process is preferred
- Simpler error handling is sufficient
- Manual session management is acceptable

**Choose ChildLoginForm when**:
- Global authentication state management is required
- Advanced security features are needed
- Complex error recovery is necessary
- AuthContext integration is preferred

#### Session Data Corruption
```bash
# Error: Corrupted session data causing login issues
# Solution: Session validation automatically clears corrupted data
```
**Fix**: The ChildLoginForm now automatically handles corrupted sessions and clears session before new login:
```typescript
// Automatic session validation on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  const sessionData = SessionManager.loadSession();
  if (sessionData) {
    const validation = SessionManager.validateSession(sessionData);
    if (!validation.isValid) {
      console.log('Clearing corrupted session:', validation.errors);
      SessionManager.clearSession();
      // Shows child-friendly error with recovery actions
    }
  }
}, []);

// Clear session before new login attempt
const handleLogin = async () => {
  // Clear any existing session before attempting new login
  SessionManager.clearSession();
  
  // Proceed with AuthContext login
  await childLogin(username, pin);
};
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Error: Can't reach database server
# Solution: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and environment variables are correct
```
**Fix**: Check your `.env` file and ensure database is running:
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps
# Or restart services
docker-compose restart postgres
```

#### Build/Compilation Errors
```bash
# Error: TypeScript compilation errors
# Solution: Run type checking and fix issues
```
**Fix**: Run type checking and linting:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run type-check
npm run lint --fix
```

#### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Error: Child login fails with 400/401 errors
# Solution: Check session management and token validation
```
**Fix**: Clear browser storage and check backend logs:
```bash
# Clear localStorage in browser dev tools
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Loading**: Enable Redis caching and check database indexes
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor component re-renders and optimize with React.memo
- **Bundle Size**: Run `npm run analyze` to identify large dependencies
