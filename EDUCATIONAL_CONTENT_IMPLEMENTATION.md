# Educational Content & Skill Tracking Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive educational content system with skill level tracking for the AI Study Planner. The system provides articles and YouTube educational videos organized by grade, subject, and topic, along with detailed skill level tracking for each child.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Educational Content Data Structure
- **Location**: `backend/src/data/educationalContentData.ts`
- **Content Types**: Articles and YouTube videos
- **Organization**: Grade → Subject → Topic → Content
- **Metadata**: Title, description, duration, difficulty, age range, tags, source, safety rating
- **Sample Content**: Covers grades 1, 5, and 8 across Math, English, Science, History, and Geography

### 2. Skill Level Tracking System
- **Location**: `backend/src/data/skillLevelData.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Individual skill profiles for each child
  - Progress tracking per subject and topic
  - Mastery levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, mastery
  - Learning velocity tracking (slow, average, fast)
  - Strength and improvement area identification
  - Automatic skill level updates based on activity completion

### 3. Backend Services & APIs
- **Educational Content Service**: `backend/src/services/educationalContentService.ts`
  - Content retrieval by grade/subject/topic
  - Skill profile management
  - Progress tracking and updates
  - Personalized content recommendations
- **API Routes**: `backend/src/routes/educationalContent.ts`
  - GET endpoints for content retrieval
  - POST endpoints for skill progress updates
  - Skill profile initialization and management

### 4. Database Integration
- **Schema Update**: Added `skillProfile` JSON field to `ChildProfile` model
- **Migration**: Created database migration for skill profile storage
- **Automatic Initialization**: New child profiles automatically get skill profiles

### 5. Frontend Components

#### Child Skill Levels Display
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/child/ChildSkillLevels.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Overall progress visualization
  - Subject-wise skill breakdown
  - Topic progress tracking
  - Strength and improvement areas display
  - Interactive accordion interface

#### Educational Content Viewer
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/studyPlan/EducationalContentViewer.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Tabbed interface for articles and videos
  - Content cards with metadata
  - Bookmark functionality
  - Content completion tracking
  - External link handling with safety

#### Child Profile Integration
- **Updated**: `frontend/src/components/child/ChildProfileCard.tsx`
- **New Feature**: "View Skills" menu option opens skill levels dialog

### 6. Demo Interface
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/demo/EducationalContentDemo.tsx`
- **Route**: `/educational-content-demo`
- **Features**:
  - Interactive content browser
  - Grade/subject/topic selection
  - Live skill levels display
  - Feature overview

## Sample Data Structure

### Educational Content Example
```typescript
{
  id: "counting-song-video-1",
  title: "Count to 10 Song | Fun Counting Video for Kids",
  description: "Catchy song to help children learn counting from 1 to 10 with animated characters.",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=counting123",
  thumbnailUrl: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/counting123/maxresdefault.jpg",
  duration: 3,
  difficulty: "beginner",
  ageRange: { min: 4, max: 8 },
  tags: ["counting", "song", "animation"],
  source: "Kids Learning TV",
  safetyRating: "safe"
}
```

### Skill Level Example
```typescript
{
  subjectId: "math-1",
  subjectName: "Mathematics",
  currentLevel: "intermediate",
  progress: 45,
  topicProgress: [
    {
      topicId: "counting-1-10",
      topicName: "Counting 1-10",
      mastery: 85,
      attemptsCount: 5,
      averageScore: 88,
      timeSpent: 25,
      lastActivity: "2024-01-15",
      status: "completed"
    }
  ],
  strengthAreas: ["basic-arithmetic"],
  improvementAreas: ["fractions", "geometry"]
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Content Retrieval
- `GET /api/educational-content/topic/:grade/:subjectId/:topicId` - Get content for specific topic
- `GET /api/educational-content/type/:grade/:subjectId/:topicId/:type` - Get articles or videos
- `GET /api/educational-content/grade/:grade` - Get all content for grade

### Skill Management
- `GET /api/educational-content/skills/:childId` - Get child's skill profile
- `GET /api/educational-content/skills/:childId/summary` - Get skill summary
- `POST /api/educational-content/skills/:childId/progress` - Update skill progress
- `GET /api/educational-content/recommendations/:childId` - Get recommended content

## Integration Points

### Study Plan Integration
- Educational content can be displayed within study plan activities
- Content completion updates skill progress automatically
- Recommendations based on current skill levels

### Child Profile Integration
- Skill levels displayed in child profile cards
- Automatic skill profile initialization for new children
- Progress tracking across all learning activities

## Usage Instructions

### For Parents
