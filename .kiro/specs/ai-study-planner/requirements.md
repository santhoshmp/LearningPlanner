## Introduction

The AI Study Planner is an educational application that enables parents to create personalized, AI-powered study plans for their children using Claude AI. The system provides a dual interface: a comprehensive parent dashboard for plan creation and progress monitoring, and a gamified child interface for engaging study experiences.
