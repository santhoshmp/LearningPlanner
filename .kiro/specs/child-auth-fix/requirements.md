# Child Authentication Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Study Planner application has critical issues with child authentication where children can log in successfully but are automatically logged out and redirected to the parent login page. This creates a broken user experience and prevents children from accessing their learning dashboard and activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stable Child Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to log in with my username and PIN and stay logged in so that I can access my learning dashboard without being automatically logged out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and maintain their session
2. WHEN a child is authenticated THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically log them out without user action
3. WHEN a child's session is active THEN the system SHALL preserve their authentication state across page refreshes
4. WHEN a child is logged in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the child dashboard, not the parent login
5. IF a child's token expires THEN the system SHALL refresh it automatically using the refresh token mechanism

### Requirement 2: Proper Session State Management

**User Story:** As a child user, I want my login session to be properly managed so that I don't lose my progress or get unexpectedly logged out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child logs in THEN the system SHALL store their authentication state with the correct user role ('CHILD')
2. WHEN storing child authentication data THEN the system SHALL use consistent data structures across frontend and backend
3. WHEN a child's session is active THEN the system SHALL track session duration and activity appropriately
4. WHEN checking authentication state THEN the system SHALL properly distinguish between child and parent users
5. IF session data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle graceful fallback without infinite redirects

### Requirement 3: Token Refresh Mechanism for Child Users

**User Story:** As a child user, I want my authentication tokens to be automatically refreshed so that I can continue learning without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child's access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically use the refresh token to get new tokens
2. WHEN refreshing child tokens THEN the system SHALL maintain the child's role and session data
3. WHEN token refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL update stored tokens without disrupting the user experience
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and prompt for re-authentication
5. IF refresh tokens are invalid THEN the system SHALL clear authentication state and redirect to child login (not parent login)

### Requirement 4: Correct Routing and Navigation

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to be directed to the appropriate pages based on my role so that I can access child-specific features and interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to '/child-dashboard'
2. WHEN an authenticated child accesses the root path THEN the system SHALL redirect them to '/child-dashboard'
3. WHEN an authenticated child tries to access parent-only routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to '/child-dashboard'
4. WHEN authentication fails for a child THEN the system SHALL redirect them to '/child-login' (not '/login')
5. IF a child's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to '/child-login' with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 5: Authentication Context Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication context to properly handle both parent and child users so that the application behaves correctly for both user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthContext initializes THEN it SHALL properly detect and load both parent and child user sessions
2. WHEN a child user is loaded from storage THEN the AuthContext SHALL set isChild to true and user role to 'CHILD'
3. WHEN refreshing authentication THEN the AuthContext SHALL handle both parent and child refresh token flows
4. WHEN logging out a child THEN the AuthContext SHALL clear child-specific session data
5. IF authentication state is inconsistent THEN the AuthContext SHALL reset to a clean state

### Requirement 6: Backend Authentication Service Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system, I want the backend authentication service to properly support child authentication flows so that frontend requests succeed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child logs in via the legacy endpoint THEN the backend SHALL return tokens in the expected format
2. WHEN refreshing child tokens THEN the backend SHALL properly handle childId-based refresh tokens
3. WHEN validating child sessions THEN the backend SHALL correctly identify and validate child authentication
4. WHEN child authentication fails THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages
5. IF child session data is missing THEN the backend SHALL handle graceful degradation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a child user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when authentication issues occur so that I can get help or try again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display child-friendly error messages
2. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL show a clear message about needing to log in again
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN authentication is stuck in a loop THEN the system SHALL break the loop and reset to login
5. IF persistent issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide options to contact parents or guardians

### Requirement 8: Security and Session Monitoring

**User Story:** As a parent, I want child authentication to be secure and properly monitored so that I can ensure my child's safety and appropriate usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child logs in THEN the system SHALL log the authentication event for parental monitoring
2. WHEN a child's session is active THEN the system SHALL track session duration and activity
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert parents and secure the session
4. WHEN a child logs out THEN the system SHALL properly clean up session data and notify parents
5. IF security violations occur THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate the session and alert parents
