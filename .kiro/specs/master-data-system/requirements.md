# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Master Data System is a comprehensive data foundation for the AI Study Planner application that provides consistent, structured educational content across all grade levels and subjects. This system establishes standardized lists of grades, ages, subjects, topics, study materials, and multimedia resources while integrating with the existing application to provide real analytics data and enhanced UI consistency. The system ensures that all educational content is properly categorized, age-appropriate, and linked to relevant learning resources including YouTube videos and reading materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to establish a comprehensive master data structure for educational content, so that the application has consistent and standardized reference data for all learning materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL contain complete grade-age mappings for educational levels from kindergarten through grade 12
2. WHEN accessing subject data THEN the system SHALL provide standardized subject categories (Math, Science, English, Social Studies, etc.) with consistent naming
3. WHEN retrieving topic data THEN the system SHALL organize topics hierarchically by grade and subject with proper relationships
4. IF new educational content is added THEN it SHALL conform to the established master data structure and validation rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want each topic to have associated study materials and multimedia resources, so that students have access to diverse learning materials for every subject area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic is selected THEN the system SHALL provide curated YouTube video URLs relevant to that specific topic and grade level
2. WHEN accessing study materials THEN the system SHALL include links to reading materials, worksheets, and interactive content
3. WHEN content is retrieved THEN the system SHALL ensure all multimedia resources are age-appropriate and educationally valuable
4. IF a resource link becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL flag it for review and provide alternative resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the master data to be integrated throughout the application, so that all dropdowns, selectors, and content references use consistent data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs grade/age data THEN it SHALL retrieve values from the centralized master data service
2. WHEN subject or topic selectors are displayed THEN they SHALL populate from the master data with consistent formatting
3. WHEN study plans are generated THEN they SHALL reference topics and materials from the master data system
4. IF master data is updated THEN all dependent components SHALL reflect the changes without code modifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to see real analytics data with meaningful visualizations, so that I can understand my child's learning progress across different subjects and topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display actual progress data using real study plan completions and activity results
2. WHEN viewing subject performance THEN the system SHALL show proficiency levels based on completed activities and assessments
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide time-based progress charts with actual data points from child interactions
4. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations and provide guidance on generating more insights

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a child, I want to see visual representations of my skill levels in each subject, so that I can understand my strengths and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my profile THEN the system SHALL display proficiency indicators for each subject I've studied
2. WHEN I complete activities THEN my proficiency visualizations SHALL update to reflect my current skill level
3. WHEN comparing subjects THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual comparisons of my performance across different areas
4. IF I haven't started a subject THEN the system SHALL show this clearly and encourage me to begin learning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have consistent UI design and behavior across all pages, so that I have a seamless and predictable experience throughout the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between different sections THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling, colors, and layout patterns
2. WHEN interacting with similar components THEN they SHALL behave consistently regardless of their location in the application
3. WHEN viewing data visualizations THEN they SHALL follow consistent design patterns and color schemes
4. IF new features are added THEN they SHALL adhere to the established UI consistency guidelines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a study plan generator, I want to use the master data to create realistic and comprehensive study plans, so that generated plans contain actual educational content rather than placeholder data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a study plan THEN the system SHALL select topics from the appropriate grade level in the master data
2. WHEN creating activities THEN the system SHALL include actual study materials and resources from the master data
3. WHEN suggesting learning paths THEN the system SHALL follow logical topic progressions defined in the master data structure
4. IF a requested combination of grade/subject/topic doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alternatives from available master data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to generate meaningful mock data based on the master data structure, so that analytics and reporting features can be demonstrated with realistic educational scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs sample data THEN it SHALL generate realistic progress records using actual topics and activities from master data
2. WHEN creating demo analytics THEN the system SHALL produce believable learning patterns and performance metrics
3. WHEN showcasing features THEN the system SHALL use real subject names, grade levels, and educational content from the master data
4. IF demo data is requested THEN it SHALL maintain referential integrity with the master data structure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the master data to be easily updatable and extensible, so that new educational content and curriculum changes can be incorporated without system redesign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN curriculum standards change THEN the master data SHALL be updatable through configuration files or database updates
2. WHEN new subjects or topics are added THEN the system SHALL accommodate them without requiring code changes
3. WHEN educational resources are updated THEN the system SHALL support bulk updates and validation of resource links
4. IF data integrity issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools and error reporting for master data maintenance
