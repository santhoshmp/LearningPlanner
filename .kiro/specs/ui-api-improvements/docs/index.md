## Overview

The AI Study Planner design system is built on Material UI v5 and provides a consistent, accessible, and visually appealing foundation for the application. The design system includes:

- A centralized theme configuration with support for light and dark modes
- Separate themes for parent and child interfaces
- A comprehensive component library with consistent styling
- Accessibility features built into the core components
- Utilities for keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Getting Started

To use the design system in your components:

1. Import the theme context:
   ```tsx
   import { useTheme } from '../../theme/ThemeContext';
   ```

2. Access the theme in your component:
   ```tsx
   const MyComponent = () => {
     const { theme, themeMode, userRole } = useTheme();
     
     return (
       <div style={{ color: theme.palette.primary.main }}>
         My Component
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

3. Use Material UI components with the theme:
   ```tsx
   import { Button, Typography } from '@mui/material';
   
   const MyComponent = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <Typography variant="h4">My Component</Typography>
         <Button variant="contained" color="primary">
           Click Me
         </Button>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

## Best Practices

When working with the design system, follow these best practices:

1. **Consistency**: Use the theme's colors, typography, and spacing consistently.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
3. **Responsiveness**: Design components to work well on all screen sizes.
4. **Performance**: Optimize components for performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Reusability**: Create components that can be reused across the application.

## Contributing

To contribute to the design system:

1. Follow the guidelines in this documentation.
2. Ensure your components are accessible and responsive.
3. Document your components with props and usage examples.
4. Write tests for your components.
5. Submit a pull request for review.

## Conclusion

This design system documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the design system used in the AI Study Planner application. By following these guidelines, developers can create consistent, accessible, and visually appealing components that enhance the user experience.
