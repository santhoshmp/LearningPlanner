# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility guidelines for the AI Study Planner application to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Core Principles

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

#### Text Alternatives
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content
- Use `alt` attributes for images
- Provide transcripts for audio content
- Use `aria-label` for interactive elements without visible text

#### Time-Based Media
- Provide captions for videos
- Provide audio descriptions for video content

#### Adaptable Content
- Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain a logical reading order in the DOM

#### Distinguishable Content
- Make it easy for users to see and hear content
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Do not use color alone to convey information
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

#### Keyboard Accessibility
- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Avoid keyboard traps
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement logical tab order

#### Enough Time
- Provide users enough time to read and use content
- Allow users to pause, stop, or extend time limits

#### Seizures and Physical Reactions
- Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions
- Avoid flashing content

#### Navigable
- Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
- Use descriptive page titles
- Implement proper heading structure
- Provide skip links for navigation

### 3. Understandable

Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.

#### Readable
- Make text content readable and understandable
- Use clear and simple language
- Identify the language of the page and any language changes

#### Predictable
- Make pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- Maintain consistent navigation
- Ensure consistent identification of components with the same functionality

#### Input Assistance
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes
- Provide clear labels for form fields
- Provide error identification and suggestions
- Offer confirmation for important actions

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

#### Compatible
- Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools
- Use valid HTML
- Ensure proper name, role, and value for all UI components
- Test with assistive technologies

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML

- Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
- Use heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) to create a logical document outline
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for groups of related items
- Use `<table>` for tabular data with proper headers
- Use `<button>` for clickable actions and `<a>` for navigation

### ARIA Attributes

- Use ARIA attributes only when necessary
- Follow the first rule of ARIA: don't use ARIA if a native HTML element or attribute can be used instead
- Use `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names
- Use `aria-describedby` to provide additional descriptions
- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, and `aria-controls` for interactive components
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

### Focus Management

- Ensure all interactive elements can receive keyboard focus
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Manage focus when content changes (e.g., opening modals)
- Use `tabindex="0"` to include elements in the natural tab order
- Avoid using `tabindex` values greater than 0

### Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `<label>` elements
- Group related form controls with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages
- Use HTML5 validation attributes where appropriate
- Ensure form controls have accessible names

### Dynamic Content

- Use ARIA live regions for important dynamic content updates
- Announce important status changes to screen readers
- Ensure custom widgets follow WAI-ARIA authoring practices
