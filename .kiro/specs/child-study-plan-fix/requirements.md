# Child Study Plan Access Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues with child access to study plans, progress tracking, and dashboard updates in the AI Study Planner application. Children are currently experiencing difficulties accessing their study plans, updating progress, and seeing real-time progress reflection in both child and parent dashboards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Child Study Plan Access

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to access my study plans seamlessly so that I can continue my learning activities without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them properly and provide access to their study plans
2. WHEN a child requests their study plans THEN the system SHALL return all accessible plans (ACTIVE, DRAFT, and PAUSED status)
3. WHEN a child accesses a specific study plan THEN the system SHALL verify ownership and return complete plan details including activities and progress
4. IF a child tries to access another child's study plan THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, child-friendly error messages

### Requirement 2: Study Plan Progress Updates

**User Story:** As a child user, I want my progress to be tracked and updated in real-time so that I can see my achievements and continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child completes an activity THEN the system SHALL update progress records immediately
2. WHEN a child updates activity progress THEN the system SHALL calculate and store time spent, score, and completion status
3. WHEN progress is updated THEN the system SHALL update learning streaks and badges accordingly
4. WHEN a child pauses and resumes an activity THEN the system SHALL track session data accurately
5. WHEN progress updates fail THEN the system SHALL retry and provide fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Real-time Dashboard Updates

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to see my latest progress reflected in my dashboard immediately so that I feel motivated and can track my achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child completes an activity THEN their dashboard SHALL reflect the updated progress within 5 seconds
2. WHEN progress is updated THEN the child dashboard SHALL show updated completion percentages, streaks, and badges
3. WHEN a child accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL load fresh data or use cached data no older than 1 minute
4. WHEN dashboard data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN offline or connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with cached data

### Requirement 4: Parent Dashboard Progress Visibility

**User Story:** As a parent user, I want to see my child's real-time progress in my dashboard so that I can monitor their learning activities and provide support when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child completes activities THEN the parent dashboard SHALL reflect updated progress within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a parent views child progress THEN the system SHALL show accurate completion rates, time spent, and recent activities
3. WHEN multiple children are managed THEN the system SHALL display individual progress for each child clearly
4. WHEN progress data is updated THEN the parent SHALL receive appropriate notifications if configured
5. WHEN parent accesses analytics THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive progress reports and trends

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a child or parent user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear guidance when issues occur so that I can continue using the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages appropriate for the user type (child vs parent)
2. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic token refresh before requiring re-login
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and provide fallback responses
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and guide users to recovery actions

### Requirement 6: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond promptly so that my learning experience is smooth and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard data is requested THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds using cached data when appropriate
2. WHEN progress is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant caches and update them with fresh data
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN performance SHALL remain consistent through proper caching strategies
4. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL refresh data transparently without user impact
5. WHEN high load occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain responsiveness through proper resource management

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want my progress data to be accurate and consistent across all parts of the application so that I can trust the information displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progress is updated THEN all related data (streaks, badges, completion rates) SHALL be updated consistently
2. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions properly to maintain data integrity
3. WHEN data synchronization issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve inconsistencies automatically
4. WHEN progress calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use accurate and up-to-date source data
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid updates and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 8: Session Management and Security

**User Story:** As a child user, I want my session to be managed securely while allowing me to continue my activities without frequent interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child is active THEN their session SHALL remain valid and automatically refresh tokens as needed
2. WHEN a child is inactive for extended periods THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeout policies
3. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL provide clear notification and easy re-authentication
4. WHEN multiple devices are used THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions appropriately
5. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL protect user data while maintaining usability
