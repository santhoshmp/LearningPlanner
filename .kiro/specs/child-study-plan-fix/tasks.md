  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance study plan data with progress information
  - Include progress records in study plan queries for children
  - Calculate completion percentages for each study plan
  - Add total and completed activity counts to study plan responses
  - Ensure activities are ordered consistently (by creation date)

- [x] 3. Create progress update API endpoint for children
  - Implement POST /api/study-plans/child/:childId/activity/:activityId/progress endpoint
  - Add proper validation for progress update data (timeSpent, score, status)
  - Ensure progress records are created or updated correctly using upsert
  - Include session data tracking for activity interactions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Fix child dashboard API to return complete data
  - Create or fix GET /api/child/:childId/dashboard endpoint
  - Include study plans with calculated progress percentages
  - Add progress summary with streaks, badges, and daily goals
  - Ensure all dashboard data is properly formatted for frontend consumption
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Update learning streak calculation on progress updates
  - Ensure streaks are updated when activities are completed
  - Fix streak calculation logic to handle daily, weekly, and activity completion streaks
  - Test that streaks increment correctly and reset appropriately
  - Verify streak data appears in dashboard responses
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 6. Implement proper error handling for child routes
  - Add child-friendly error messages for common scenarios
  - Implement proper HTTP status codes for different error types
  - Add request validation and sanitization
  - Ensure errors are logged appropriately for debugging
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Test child study plan access end-to-end
  - Create test script to verify child login and study plan access
  - Test progress updates and verify they persist correctly
  - Verify dashboard shows updated progress after activity completion
  - Test error scenarios (invalid tokens, missing plans, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 8. Update frontend child dashboard to handle new API responses
  - Modify child dashboard component to use new dashboard API endpoint
  - Update progress display components to show accurate completion data
  - Add proper loading states and error handling for API calls
  - Ensure study plan cards show correct progress information
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 5.1_

- [x] 9. Fix parent dashboard to show child progress updates
  - Ensure parent dashboard API includes up-to-date child progress
  - Update parent dashboard components to display real-time progress
  - Add proper data aggregation for multiple children
  - Test that parent sees updates when child completes activities
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 10. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - Add detailed logging for study plan access attempts
  - Log progress update operations with success/failure status
  - Implement error tracking for dashboard API calls
  - Add performance monitoring for database queries
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 6.1, 7.3_

- [x] 11. Create database indexes for performance optimization
  - Add index on progress_records(child_id, activity_id) for faster lookups
  - Add index on study_plans(child_id) for child plan queries
  - Add index on learning_streaks(child_id, streak_type) for streak queries
  - Test query performance improvements with indexes
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 12. Implement data validation and consistency checks
  - Add validation for progress update payloads (score ranges, time limits)
  - Ensure activity completion updates study plan progress correctly
  - Add checks for data consistency between progress records and dashboard summaries
  - Implement transaction handling for multi-table updates
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.4_
