- **Issue:** Validation errors for required/disallowed fields
- **Errors Encountered:**
  - "duration" is not allowed
  - "gradeLevel" is not allowed
  - Missing required fields in validation schema
- **Impact:** Parents cannot create new study plans

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
- **Status:** ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- **Issue:** Analytics endpoints return 404 errors
- **Tested Endpoints:**
  - `/analytics/child/{childId}`
  - `/analytics/{childId}`
  - `/analytics?childId={childId}`
  - `/child-profiles/{childId}/analytics`
- **Impact:** Parents cannot view child progress analytics

### 4. Content Safety System
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILING
- **Issue:** Validation errors in content safety checks
- **Error:** "Invalid request data" with validation details
- **Impact:** Content safety monitoring not functional

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### High Priority (Critical for Basic Functionality)

1. **Fix Child Login Authentication**
   - Investigate server-side authentication service
   - Check database connectivity for child profiles
   - Verify PIN hashing/comparison logic
   - Review authentication middleware

2. **Fix Study Plan Generation**
   - Update validation schema to match expected fields
   - Remove conflicting field requirements
   - Test with minimal required data set

### Medium Priority (Important for Full Functionality)

3. **Implement Analytics Endpoints**
   - Create or fix analytics routes
   - Ensure proper data aggregation
   - Test with sample progress data

4. **Fix Content Safety Validation**
   - Update validation schema for content safety
   - Test with proper request format
   - Verify safety rating system

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Fix child login authentication (highest priority)
   - Resolve study plan generation validation issues
   - Implement missing analytics endpoints

2. **Testing Recommendations:**
   - Use the provided test tools to verify fixes
   - Test with multiple child profiles
   - Verify parent-child data synchronization

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Check backend server logs for detailed error information
   - Monitor database connections and queries
   - Verify JWT token generation and validation

## üìù CONCLUSION

The AI Study Planner shows strong foundation with working parent authentication and child profile management. However, critical child-facing features need immediate attention to provide a complete user experience. The parent dashboard functionality is solid, but child login and study plan generation require fixes before the system can be considered fully functional.

**Priority:** Focus on child authentication first, as this blocks all child-specific functionality testing.
