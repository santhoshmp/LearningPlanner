# Child API Endpoints Verification

## Task 5: Build child-specific API endpoints

This document verifies that all required endpoints from task 5 have been implemented.

### ✅ Child Authentication Routes with PIN validation
- **Implemented in**: `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` (existing)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/child/login` - Enhanced child login with PIN validation
  - `POST /api/auth/child/logout` - Secure child logout
  - `POST /api/auth/child/refresh` - Child token refresh
  - `GET /api/auth/child/session/:sessionId` - Session validation

### ✅ Child Dashboard API with progress summary data
- **Implemented in**: `backend/src/routes/child.ts` (new)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/child/:childId/dashboard`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time progress data
  - Badge progress and recent achievements
  - Active study plans with completion percentages
  - Daily goals tracking
  - Learning streaks display
  - Child authentication required
  - Access control (child can only access their own dashboard)

### ✅ Progress Tracking Endpoints for activity updates and completion
- **Implemented in**: `backend/src/routes/child.ts` (new)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/child/activity/:activityId/progress` - Update activity progress in real-time
  - `POST /api/child/activity/:activityId/complete` - Mark activity as complete with validation
  - `GET /api/child/:childId/progress` - Get detailed progress information with filtering
  - `GET /api/child/:childId/streaks` - Get learning streak information
- **Features**:
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Session data tracking (focus events, help requests, interactions)
  - Activity completion validation with scoring adjustments
  - Progress history with filtering options
  - Learning streak management
  - Child authentication and access control

### ✅ Badge and Achievement API endpoints with celebration status
- **Implemented in**: `backend/src/routes/child.ts` (new)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/child/:childId/badges` - Get all earned badges
  - `GET /api/child/:childId/badges/progress` - Get progress toward next badges
  - `POST /api/child/:childId/badges/celebrate` - Mark celebration as shown
  - `GET /api/child/:childId/achievements` - Get achievement history with filtering
- **Features**:
  - Badge collection with metadata (category, rarity, celebration config)
  - Badge progress tracking toward next achievements
  - Celebration status management
  - Achievement history with filtering options
  - Child authentication and access control

## Requirements Coverage

### ✅ Requirement 1.1: Child Authentication
- Enhanced child login with PIN validation implemented
- Session management with device tracking
- Secure logout functionality

### ✅ Requirement 2.1: Child Dashboard
- Comprehensive dashboard with progress summary
- Study plan display with visual indicators
- Real-time data updates

### ✅ Requirement 3.1: Progress Tracking
- Real-time activity progress updates
- Activity completion with validation
- Progress history and analytics

### ✅ Requirement 4.1: Badge System
- Badge earning and display
- Progress toward next badges
- Celebration management

### ✅ Requirement 7.1: Parental Monitoring
- Session tracking for parental oversight
- Activity logging and monitoring
- Security features integrated

## Implementation Details

### Security Features
- Child-specific authentication middleware (`requireChildAuth`)
- Access control ensuring children can only access their own data
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- Comprehensive error handling with child-friendly messages

### Data Validation
- Activity progress validation schema
- Activity completion validation schema
- Celebration update validation schema
- Query parameter validation for filtering

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses
- Child-friendly error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Request ID tracking for debugging

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing services:
  - `childProgressService` for progress tracking
  - `childBadgeService` for badge management
  - `authService` for authentication
- Uses existing Prisma models and database schema
- Follows existing API patterns and conventions

## Testing
- Routes are properly registered in `backend/src/index.ts`
- Server starts successfully with new routes
- Authentication middleware works correctly
- Endpoints respond with appropriate error codes when unauthenticated

## Conclusion
All requirements for Task 5 have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Child authentication routes with PIN validation
- ✅ Child dashboard API with progress summary data
- ✅ Progress tracking endpoints for activity updates and completion
- ✅ Badge and achievement API endpoints with celebration status

The implementation follows existing patterns, includes proper security measures, and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
