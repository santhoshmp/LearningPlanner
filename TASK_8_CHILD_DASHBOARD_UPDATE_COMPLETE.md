- Added support for study plans with progress percentages and time tracking
- Enhanced badge system with recent achievements and progress tracking
- Added daily goals with progress percentages

### 2. API Integration Updates
- **Modified childDashboardApi.getDashboard()** to handle the new response structure
- Updated API response parsing to extract dashboard data correctly
- Added proper date transformation for API response fields
- Enhanced progress update API calls with new endpoint structure
- Added support for real-time progress updates with proper child ID validation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Added comprehensive loading states** during API calls
- Implemented retry functionality with loading indicators
- Added graceful fallback to mock data when API fails
- Enhanced error messages with user-friendly content
- Added proper error recovery mechanisms

### 4. UI Component Improvements
- **Added refresh button** in the header with loading state
- Enhanced study plan progress cards with loading indicators
- Updated streak display to use new API data structure
- Improved daily goals widget with accurate progress percentages
- Added real-time data update indicators

### 5. Loading State Management
- **Implemented proper loading states** for initial data fetch
- Added loading indicators for manual refresh operations
- Enhanced button states during API operations
- Added loading feedback for study plan interactions

## Requirements Verification

### âœ… Requirement 3.1: Real-time Dashboard Updates
- Dashboard reflects updated progress within 5 seconds
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh functionality
- Real-time progress calculation and display

### âœ… Requirement 3.3: Loading States and Error Handling
- Appropriate loading states during API calls
- Clear error messages with retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation with cached/mock data
- User-friendly error recovery options

### âœ… Requirement 5.1: Error Handling
- Child-friendly error messages
- Proper HTTP status code handling
- Request validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Response Handling
```typescript
// Enhanced API response parsing
const response = await childDashboardApi.getDashboard(user.id);
const dashboardData = response.dashboard || response;

// Date transformation
if (dashboardData.progressSummary?.lastActivityDate) {
  dashboardData.progressSummary.lastActivityDate = new Date(dashboardData.progressSummary.lastActivityDate);
}
```

### Loading State Management
```typescript
const fetchDashboardData = useCallback(async (showLoading = false) => {
  if (showLoading) {
    setIsLoading(true);
  }
  // ... API call logic
  finally {
    if (showLoading) {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
// Retry functionality with loading states
<button
  onClick={() => fetchDashboardData(true)}
  disabled={isLoading}
  style={{ opacity: isLoading ? 0.7 : 1 }}
>
  {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Try Again ðŸ”„'}
</button>
```

## New Features Added

### 1. Refresh Functionality
- Manual refresh button in header
- Loading indicator during refresh
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Last updated timestamp display

### 2. Enhanced Progress Display
- Study plan cards show accurate completion percentages
- Time spent tracking per study plan
- Average score display
- Progress bars with smooth animations

### 3. Improved Streak Display
- Uses new API streak data structure
- Multiple streak types support (daily, activity completion, etc.)
- Visual streak indicators with animations
- Streak history and best streak display

### 4. Daily Goals Widget
- Progress percentages from API
- Visual progress bars
- Goal completion celebrations
- Time and activity tracking
